<P>Crypto++ 5.6.5 was released on October 11, 2016. The 5.6.5 release was mostly a maintenance release. The release included two CVE fixes.</P>

<P>The first, CVE-2016-7420, was a procedural finding due to external build systems failing to define <tt>NDEBUG</tt> for release builds. The procedural gap was a failure to tell users to define it. The second, CVE-2016-7544, was a potential memory corruption on Windows platforms when using Microsoft compilers due to use of <tt>_malloca</tt> and <tt>_freea</tt>.</P>
