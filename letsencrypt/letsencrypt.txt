
1. Log-in to VM, su to root with "sudo su -".
   CD to root's home with "cd ~".
   An existing CSR using the existing key is in Home.

2. Open a second terminal, su to root.
   CD to /var/www/html/.well-known/acme-challenge/.
   Remove past challenges.
 
3. letsencrypt --manual --csr ~/cryptopp-com.req.pem auth
   This terminal is now occupied by LE client.
   LE client will send requests and receive responses.

   LE client will tell you to create a file with specific content.
   Create the nessary files in the other terminal. Once the
   challenges have been accepted client will download new cert.

4. Once the certifcate issues, copy it to cryptopp-com.pem

   # cp 0000_cert.pem /etc/pki/tls/certs/cryptopp-com.pem
   cp: overwrite ‘/etc/pki/tls/certs/cryptopp-com.pem’? y

   The existing chain should be OK, but it can be copied if desired.
   Test the website. Once tested it is OK to delete the local
   Let's Encrypt artifacts in Home.

   It is also OK to execute the procedure multiple times while
   learning the process. Let's Encrypt will issue a new certifcate
   on a second or thrid run.
